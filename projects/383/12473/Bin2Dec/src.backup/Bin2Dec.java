/*
Write a program called Bin2Dec to convert an input binary string into its equivalent decimal number. 

You can use JDK method Math.pow(x, y) to compute the x raises to the power of y. 
This method takes two doubles as argument and returns a double. You may have to cast the result back to int.

To convert a char (of digit '0' to '9') to int (0 to 9), simply subtract by char '0', e.g., '5'-'0' gives int 5.
